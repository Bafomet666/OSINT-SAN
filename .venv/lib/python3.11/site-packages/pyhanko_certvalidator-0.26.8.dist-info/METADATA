# certvalidator

This library started as a fork of [wbond/certvalidator](https://github.com/wbond/certvalidator) with patches for [pyHanko](https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/pyHanko), but has since diverged considerably from its parent repository.

GitHub issues are disabled on this repository. Bug reports regarding this library should be submitted to the [pyHanko issue tracker](https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/pyHanko/issues).
Similarly, questions regarding this library's usage can be asked in the [pyHanko discussion forum](https://github.com/MatthiasValvekens/pyHanko/discussions).

`pyhanko-certvalidator` is a Python library for validating X.509 certificates paths. It supports various
options, including: validation at a specific moment in time, whitelisting and revocation checks.

## Current Release

![pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyhanko-certvalidator.svg) - [changelog](changelog.md)

## Dependencies

 - *asn1crypto*
 - *cryptography*
 - *uritools*
 - *oscrypto*
 - *requests* or *aiohttp* (use the latter for more efficient asyncio, requires resource management)
 - Python 3.7 or higher

 ### Note on compatibility

 Starting with `pyhanko-certvalidator` version `0.17.0`, the library has been refactored to use asynchronous I/O as much as possible. Most high-level API entrypoints can still be used synchronously, but have been deprecated in favour of their asyncio equivalents. 
 As part of this move, the OCSP and CRL clients now have two separate implementations: a `requests`-based one, and an `aiohttp`-based one. The latter is probably more performant, but requires more resource management efforts on the caller's part, which was impossible to implement without making major breaking changes to the public API that would make the migration path more complicated. Therefore, the `requests`-based fetcher will remain the default for the time being.


## Installation

```bash
pip install pyhanko-certvalidator
```

## License

*certvalidator* is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. See the
[LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the exact license text.



## Testing

### Test framework

Tests are written using `pytest` and require an asynchronous test case backend
such as `pytest-asyncio`.

### Test cases

The test cases for the library are comprised of:

 - [Public Key Interoperability Test Suite from NIST](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/crypto_apps_infra/pki/pkitesting.html)
 - [OCSP tests from OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/test/recipes/80-test_ocsp.t)
 - Various certificates generated for TLS certificate validation
