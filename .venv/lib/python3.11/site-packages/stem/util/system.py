"""
Helper functions for working with the underlying system. These are mostly os
dependent, only working on linux, osx, and bsd. In almost all cases they're
best-effort, providing **None** if the lookup fails.

.. versionchanged:: 1.3.0
   Dropped the get_* prefix from several function names. The old names still
   work, but are deprecated aliases.

.. versionchanged:: 1.5.0
   Added the **SYSTEM_CALL_TIME** global, which tracks total time spent making
   system commands.

**Module Overview:**

::

  is_windows - checks if we're running on windows
  is_mac - checks if we're running on a mac
  is_gentoo - checks if we're running on gentoo
  is_slackware - checks if we're running on slackware
  is_bsd - checks if we're running on the bsd family of operating systems

  is_available - determines if a command is available on this system
  is_running - determines if a given process is running
  size_of - provides the memory usage of an object
  call - runs the given system command and provides back the results

  name_by_pid - gets the name for a process by the given pid
  pid_by_name - gets the pid for a process by the given name
  pid_by_port - gets the pid for a process listening to a given port
  pid_by_open_file - gets the pid for the process with an open file
  pids_by_user - provides processes owned by a user
  cwd - provides the current working directory for a given process
  user - provides the user a process is running under
  start_time - provides the unix timestamp when the process started
  tail - provides lines from the end of a file
  bsd_jail_id - provides the BSD jail id a given process is running within
  bsd_jail_path - provides the path of the given BSD jail

  is_tarfile - checks if the given path is a tarball
  expand_path - expands relative paths and ~ entries
  files_with_suffix - provides files with the given suffix

  get_process_name - provides our process' name
  set_process_name - changes our process' name
