This package provides bindings to the generic input event interface in Linux.
The *evdev* interface serves the purpose of passing events generated in the
kernel directly to userspace through character devices that are typically
located in `/dev/input/`.

This package also comes with bindings to *uinput*, the userspace input
subsystem. *Uinput* allows userspace programs to create and handle input devices
that can inject events directly into the input subsystem.
